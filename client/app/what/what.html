    TL;DR, I'm getting fatter because I drink too much. My 2015 New Year's Resolution is to run 1km for every drink I have. This app helps me count the number of drinks I have.

    It is the year 2015. This winter, a bunch of my friends came to visit me in Japan for an amazing 2 weeks - which was all good and well... until, well afterwards.
  </p>

  <p class="h-margin-x-large v-margin-x-large">
    A very common custom in Japan is to drink while you eat, and counter to other popular beliefs in different cultures, beer is pretty much like water there. So yeah, it's not very common when someone tells you they've been having beer for the past two weeks non-stop. Which is kind of what happened.
  </p>

  <p class="h-margin-x-large v-margin-x-large">
    So, I decided to take on a challenge which still allows me to pursue my cultural needs, while staying relatively healthy. That's pretty easy - run if you drink. Right?
  </p>

  <p class="h-margin-x-large v-margin-x-large">
    The rules are pretty simple. <em>For every drink* I have, I run 1km.</em> Another factor is that this is counted weekly, the week starting on Sunday 0:00am and ending Saturday 11:59pm. During that week, I try to satisfy my drinking quota with running. If I don't complete my quota for some reason, the number of drinks I didn't run for gets carried over to the next week, with <em>25% interest</em>. If you're thinking, that's too easy, either you don't drink enough, or you run too much.

    * Drink, defined rather vaguely by "a drink that is purchasable for one person at a bar", such as a bottle of beer, a glass of wine, a shot, etc. The point is not to be strict with the rule - it is a source of motivation so this is purposefully vague. I will try to be as harsh as possible while keeping myself sane.
  </p>

  <p class="h-margin-x-large v-margin-x-large">I will log my running on RunKeeper&#0153;, which actually has a (not so nice) API. It will automatically calculate how much I have run, and deduct the number of drinks it adds up to. This way, I can see in relatively realtime how I am doing with this.</p>

    Lastly, I've made it so you can join too! If you are not only just interested in seeing how I do but want to join the challenge:
